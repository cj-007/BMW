          Did you get a good feeling when you called in to inquire about service for your BMW? A quality BMW repair shop will have a friendly and knowledgeable service advisor ready to answer your questions and help you make arrangements to bring your BMW in for service. If circumstances permit, it’s also a great idea to bring your car to an independent repair shop for a minor scheduled service to get to know the shop and their staff. This is a low pressure way to make sure you’ll be comfortable trusting the shop with more in-depth BMW services.

A BMW Master Certified Technician has a minimum of five years of experience working on BMW vehicles in a BMW approved environment. These mechanics were often trained through the highly competitive BMW STEP (Service Technician Education Program) which includes a classroom component, followed by an internship in a BMW dealer service center. While Master Certification is not a must-have, you will want to find a repair shop that employs technicians with dealer level experience. These shops pride themselves on their reputations as specialists and work to ensure their technicians are up to date on the latest tools and training.
